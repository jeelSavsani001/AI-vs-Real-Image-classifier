# AI-vs-Real-Image-classifier
The model classifies the input image into whether it is AI or Real image. It is made from scratch using CNN architecture. 
Additional layers of network are added to increase the accuracy and decrease loss.
The model has approx. 62% accuracy without using any pre-trained model.
The dataset used is not public so I can't provide it.
Image classification is one of the application of CNN models.
